Web system integrated with ERP for external sales and freight control.

This system was developed in Java and utilized the Spring Framework, Spring Security, and Primefaces Framework. It features a SOAP integration with the ERP contracted by the company, allowing external sales representatives to make sales directly at the client's location without the need for the company to acquire an ERP license for each representative. The system also includes a freight control module developed according to the company's needs, enabling the registration of drivers, delivery cities, and contract generation.
